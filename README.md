# Creatives Rebuild New York (CRNY) Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview

The Creatives Rebuild New York (CRNY) initiative, launched in January 2021 with the support of the Mellon Foundation, aims to revitalize New York's arts and culture sector, which was significantly impacted by COVID-19. CRNY focuses on addressing racial, gender, and economic inequalities within the cultural ecosystem by supporting individual artists across New York State through two key programs:

1. **Guaranteed Income for Artists:** Provides $1,000 per month for 18 months to individual artists, with no strings attached, to recognize and support artistic labor and foster a strong sense of community among artists.

2. **Artist Employment Programs:** Designed to offer employment opportunities and further support for artists in New York.

This repository contains the data collected from applicants and participants of the Guaranteed Income for Artists program. The data was gathered from 2,400 artists who enrolled in the program, as well as those who applied but were not selected. Additionally, survey responses from about 54% of the participating artists are included.

## Data Set Description

The dataset includes the following:

- **Application Data:** Information from 2,400 artists who enrolled in the Guaranteed Income program and those who applied but were not selected.
- **Survey Responses:** Data from a separate survey completed by about 54% of the artists, capturing additional insights.

### Key Features

- **Participants:** Individual artists who lived in New York State and were at least 18 years old at the time of application.
- **Guaranteed Income:** Financial support provided to selected artists over an 18-month period.
- **Survey Data:** Detailed responses offering insights into the artists' experiences and the impact of the program.

## Project Goals

The Arts, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation Lab at the Center for Cultural Affairs is collaborating with CRNY to integrate this data into a publicly accessible data visualization website, scheduled for launch in 2024. The website aims to provide valuable insights to:

- **Policy and Government Officials:** To inform and shape policies that support the arts and cultural sector.
- **Arts Practitioners:** To understand the challenges and needs of artists in New York.
- **General Public:** To raise awareness of the program's impact and the role of artists in the cultural ecosystem.
